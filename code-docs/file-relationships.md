Please provide the file relationships you'd like me to analyze.  I need the information about the files and how they relate to each other.  For example, you could provide this information in a few ways:

* **A list of files and their dependencies:**

```
main.py: utils.py, data.csv
utils.py: config.ini
model.py: utils.py, training_data.csv
```

* **A diagram (even a simple text-based one):**

```
main.py --> utils.py --> config.ini
main.py --> data.csv
model.py --> utils.py
model.py --> training_data.csv
```

* **A description in words:**

```
The main.py script uses functions from utils.py and reads data from data.csv.  The utils.py script reads configuration parameters from config.ini.  The model.py script also uses utils.py and reads training data from training_data.csv.
```

Once you provide the file relationships, I can create comprehensive documentation that explains the architecture and dependencies.  This documentation will include:

* **A clear description of each file's purpose.**
* **A visualization of the dependencies (if possible).**
* **An explanation of the data flow between files.**
* **Potential points of failure or areas for improvement.**


I'm ready to help once you provide the necessary information.
